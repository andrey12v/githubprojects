For this assignment you are going to implement several sorting algorithms.
RESTRICTIONS:
-	You may NOT import java.util.Comparator
	o	you must write your own comparators
-	You may NOT import java.util.Arrays
	o	You must write your own copy methods for any arrays
	o	You may NOT use any of the Java Array sorting features.
	o	Exception, in the mergeSort you can call the Arrays.copyOfRange method
-	You may NOT import any other Java container class.
	o	e.g. you must use your own Queue, LinkedQueue, SinglyLinkedList, etc. classes.

Task 1:
Create an employee Class that encapsulates the concept of an employee.  The attributes of an employee are:
-	id
	o	a random integer in the range 0 to 99999999 (i.e. like a social security number)
	o	we will ignore the fact that we may get duplicate id numbers
-	name
	o	a String of a random length between 5 and 10 characters (inclusive) made up of a random set of lower case characters
-	dept
	o	a random integer in the range 1 to 5 (inclusive)
-	hired
	o	a random integer in the range 1995 to 2010 (inclusive)

Task 2:
Create a class named Sort that will act as a container for the following generic array sorting algorithms:
-	simpleBubbleSort
	o	a brute force bubble sort that just uses a pair of nested loops
	o	this needs to be a generic bubble sort
	o	this needs to be a stable sort
-	mergeSort
	o	this should be the recursive mergeSort described in the textbook
-	quickSort
	o	this should be the recursive quickSort described in the textbook
	o	you may have to modify this code
-	radixSort
	o	this should be a generic sort
	o	the radixSort should be able to support between two and four keys
	o	the first parameter in the parameter list should be the array being sorted.
	o	the remaining parameters in the parameter list should be the keys, ordered left to right from most significant to least significant

Task 3:
-	Create a client class that
	o	Generates an array of any number of employees
	o	Sort the employee array on name using the merge sort
	o	Sort the employee array on dept using the quick sort
	o	Sort the employee array using the radix sort so that
		*	All employees are sorted by department
		*	Within a department grouping all the employees are sorted by hire date
		*	Within a department and hire date grouping all the employees are sorted by their name
