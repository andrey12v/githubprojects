TASK:

You want to develop a Java program that will allow you to keep track of contacts in your address book.  In reviewing your address book, you notice that your contacts fall into two categories: Friend contacts and Business contacts.  The following table shows the information that you keep in your address book for each type of contact.

Field		Friend	Business
Name		Yes	Yes
Title		No	Yes
Business Name	No	Yes
Address		Yes	Yes
Phone		Yes	Yes
Birthday 	Yes	No
Favorite Movie	Yes	No


Create a NetBeans project named Lab01

In this project create three classes named Contact, Friend and Business such that:
-	The Contact class contains all of the fields common to both types of entries in your address book.
-	The Friend class is a subclass of Contact and contains only those fields that are specific to the Friend entries in your address book.
-	The Business class is a subclass of Contact and contains only those fields that are specific to the Business entries in your address book.
-	Each of these classes contains all of the “normally expected” methods.
	o	At least one constructor
	o	A getter and setter (accessor and mutator) method for each instance/class variable
	o	A toString method
	o	An equals method
-	Create your classes so that you can keep track of the 
	o	Number of Friend contacts
	o	Number of Business contacts
	o	Total number of contacts

Create a fourth class name Client that will be used to test your other classes.  In the Client class:
-	Create an array named addressBook of Contact
-	Add a minimum of three Business contacts to the array
-	Add a minimum of three Friend contacts to the array
-	Data for each of the contacts must be entered from the keyboard.
-	Test all of the methods in Contact, Friend and Business that are not explicitly tested in their respective class definitions.
