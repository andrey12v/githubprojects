Assignment Prefix:     lab12
Points: 100
Due Date:     Tuesday, December 6, 2016 @ 11:59pm

For this assignment you may use any classes from the online version of the code for the textbook.  The textbook code is in a jar (Java archive) file which uses the zip file format.  One easy way to deal with a jar file is to rename the file with a .zip extension, use Windows Explorer to browse the zip archive, and copy and paste the necessary class files into your NetBeans project directory.
Note that I still believe that there is a learning benefit from transcribing the code from the textbook but you are allowed to copy and paste the code from the online jar file.
Task 1: 
-	Create a new NetBeans project named Lab12
-	Place the GraphExamples.java file from the online version of the code for the textbook into your project’s source code directory
-	This GraphExamples.java file contains the main class.
-	Add additional .java files from the online version of the code for the textbook until you are able to compile and run the main class without errors.
-	Points will be deducted for any unnecessary Java classes that are included in your assignment.
-	Notice that the output of the program is essentially the Adjacency List Structure described in section 14.2.2
Task 2:
-	Modify your project so that in addition to printing out the Adjacency List Structure it also prints out the Adjacency Matrix Structure as a nicely formatted ASCII table.
-	Write your code so that:
	o	 It uses the same input (i.e. an edge list).
	o	It can correctly handle edge lists that represent
		*	Directed or undirected graphs by using a boolean parameter as is already done to create the Adjacency List Structure.
		*	Weighted or unweighted graphs automatically (without the use of a parameter) by examining the edge list.
	o	Examples of the output can be found at the end of this assignment.

Below is an example of what your output should look like:
