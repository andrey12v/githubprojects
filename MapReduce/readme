The Map Reduce project was implemented in Java programming language for the class “CSCI 650 - Cloud Computing” that I took at NDSU. The main idea of this project is to calculate weighted sum for every single class (every line) from the input file in the Map function. After that, using the Reduce procedure, group all records together by class number (line number) calculate average, minimum and maximum values. The project also requires to run Map Reduce on different number of nodes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.
